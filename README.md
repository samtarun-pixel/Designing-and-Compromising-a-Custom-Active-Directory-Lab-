# Designing and Compromising a Custom Active Directory Lab

## Overview
This project documents the design, deployment, and compromise of a
custom-built enterprise Active Directory environment.

The goal is to simulate a realistic **internal penetration test**
by intentionally engineering misconfigurations and assessing them
from an attacker’s perspective.

This is not a prebuilt lab or walkthrough-based exercise.
